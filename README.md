- Earthquake Data Visualization

This project is a web-based application that visualizes earthquake data provided by the USGS (United States Geological Survey). The map is generated using the Leaflet library and displays earthquakes that occurred in the past week. Each earthquake is represented as a marker on the map, where the size of the marker corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake and the color corresponds to the depth of the earthquake.

# Features

* Interactive map displaying recent earthquakes.
* Markers sized based on earthquake magnitude.
* Markers colored based on earthquake depth.
* Popups with detailed information for each earthquake.
* A legend explaining the depth color coding.

# Files

* index.html: The main webpage that includes the map container and loads the necessary libraries.
* style.css: Contains all the styles for the map, body, and legend.
* logic.js: JavaScript code to create the map, load and visualize the earthquake data, and add a legend.

There is a part of code where AI was used:

 I utilized OpenAI's ChatGPT for assistance with refining the CSS styles for the legend, ensuring that the legend's appearance matched the desired design. ChatGPT provided valuable guidance on how to structure the legend with appropriate styling for color boxes, background, and text alignment.
 
 We can see this in our style.css file.
